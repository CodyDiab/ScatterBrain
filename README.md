## Description
### This application uses MySql2, nodemon, sequelize, dotenv, scss, and handlebars to create a user generated index of visited sites and the pertinent information found within. Keeping a detailed index of sites visited and the reason behind why it was searched in the first place will help the user keep better track of any projects or hobbies they might have that require a fair bit of research. 

## Screenshot of the webpage:
### Homepage lists subject tabs, each of which can contain a library of links and notes pertaining to a certain topic.
